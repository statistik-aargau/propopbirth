## Overview

Here the **birth rate forecast** according to the **methodology of the
FSO** (Federal Statistical Office) is used. The first step is to
**prepare the model input data**. This is described in this vignette.
The starting point is past birth and population data. Three input data
sets have to be prepared:

- **TFR** (total fertility rate) per year
- **MAB** (mean age of the mother at birth) per year
- **fertility rate** per age year

If the final forecast should distinguish by **nationality** and/or
**spatial unit**, the three input data sets must also be differentiated
according to these variables.

## Required data

You need birth and population data from the past to prepare the input
data. **If you don’t have such data at hand, you can run the functions
with example data**. Regardless of whether you bring your own or use
example data, the structure of the data frames require the following
variables:

[TABLE]

## Births

Currently, the FSO does not publish historical births data as open data.
However, we have received permission to use and publish the data in
[propopbirth](https://statistik-aargau.github.io/propopbirth_test/). In
the [propopbirth](https://statistik-aargau.github.io/propopbirth_test/)
package, the original data from the FSO is preprocessed, adapting column
names and factor levels, and the municipality numbers are replaced by
[municipality
names](https://www.agvchapp.bfs.admin.ch/de/state/results?SnapshotDate=1.1.2023).

The data for three selected municipalities looks like this:

``` r
# load package data
data("fso_birth", package = "propopbirth")

fso_birth |>
  dplyr::filter(spatial_unit %in% c("Aarau", "Frauenfeld", "Stadt Zürich")) |>
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

## Population

Historical population records from the FSO can be obtained with the
function
[`propopbirth::get_population_data`](https://statistik-aargau.github.io/propopbirth_test/reference/get_population_data.md),
defining time span, spatial units and further specific arguments:

``` r
fso_pop <- get_population_data(
  number_fso = "px-x-0102010000_101",
  year_first = 2010,
  year_last = 2023,
  age_fert_min = 15,
  age_fert_max = 49,
  spatial_code = c("4001", "4566", "0261"),
  spatial_unit = c("Aarau", "Frauenfeld", "Stadt Zürich"),
  binational = TRUE
)
```

The data for three selected municipalities looks like this:

``` r
fso_pop |>
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

## Create input data

First, the **mean annual population** is calculated for females within
the so-called ‘fertile age’ (usually 15 to 49). For each group
(e.g. spatial unit, age, nationality) and year the mean population is
calculated by the average of the population at the beginning and the end
of the year.

Second, the births per year and group (e.g. spatial unit, age,
nationality) are divided by the mean population (number of women of this
group). This gives the **age-specific fertility** rate per year and
group.

The **TFR (total fertility rate)** is calculated as the sum of the
age-specific fertility rate over age per year and group (spatial unit,
nationality).

The **MAB (mean age of the mother at birth)** is also computed based on
the age-specific fertility rate per year. For this calculation a
weighted average over age is used.

The parameter `fert_hist_years` determines how many years are used to
calculate an average **age-specific fertility rate**. The FSO usually
uses only one year for its cantonal calculations. However, age-specific
fertility rates can vary substantially from year to year, especially for
small spatial units. Therefore, it makes sense to take the average over
multiple years. For this computation the births and population are
averaged over the years; then the ratio between births and population is
calculated.

``` r
input <- create_input_data(
  population = fso_pop,
  births = fso_birth |> 
    dplyr::filter(spatial_unit %in% c("Aarau", "Frauenfeld", "Stadt Zürich")),
  year_first = 2011,
  year_last = 2023,
  age_fert_min = 15,
  age_fert_max = 49,
  fert_hist_years = 3,
  binational = TRUE
) 
```

### TFR

``` r
ggplot(input$tfr) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tfr, color = nat)) +
  facet_wrap(~ spatial_unit) +
  theme_minimal()
```

``` r
input$tfr |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

### MAB

``` r
ggplot(input$mab) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mab, color = nat)) +
  facet_wrap(~ spatial_unit)+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](prepare_data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

``` r
input$mab |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

### Age-specific fertility rate

``` r
ggplot(input$fer) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age, y = fer, color = nat)) +
  facet_wrap(~ spatial_unit)+
  theme_minimal()
```

``` r
input$fer |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```
