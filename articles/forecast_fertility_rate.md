# Fertility rate forecast

## Model structure

The age-specific fertility rate forecast is modeled in four steps:

- **Cumulate, standardize**: The age-specific fertility rate (see input
  data preparation) is cumulated and standardized to values between 0
  and 1. This cumulated and standardized value is called $y*$.

- **Regression**: First, $y*$ is transformed. Then, a fifth-degree
  regression is fitted to $y*$ vs. $x$ (i.e. age + 0.5). The parameters
  $a_{0}$, …, $a_{5}$ of the regression are estimated.

\$\$ y = \log(-\log(y^\*)) \\ x = age + 0.5 \\ y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2
x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 \$\$

- **Optimization**: In this step, the previously calculated MAB forecast
  is used (MAB prediction for each year in the future). From the
  regression above, all parameters are kept constant except $a_{0}$. For
  every year in the future, only the value of $a_{0}$ is changed (only
  the intercept, all other regression coefficients are kept constant).
  This is done for every year until the y-values (back transformed to
  fertility rates) result in the previously calculated MAB forecast.

- **Reverse**: In this step, the TFR forecast calculated earlier is
  applied. The standardized fertility rate is multiplied by the TFR
  forecast. As a result you get the future age-specific fertility rates.

![The model structure consists of several procedures: First, the
age-specific fertility rate is cumulated and standardized to values
between zero and one. Second, the cumulated and standardized values are
fitted in a regression to a fifth-degree polynomial of age. Third, the
estimated regression coefficients remain constant, except the intercept;
with optimization, the intercept in changed to achieve the previously
calculated future MAB values. Fourth, the calculations are reversed to
get standardized age-specific fertility rates. Fifth, the standardized
values are multiplied by TFR to estimate future age-specific fertility
rates.](figures/fertility_rate_forecast.png)

## Code example

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(propopbirth)
library(dplyr)
```

Create input data

``` r
input <- create_input_data(
  population = fso_pop,
  births = fso_birth |>
    dplyr::filter(spatial_unit %in% c("Aarau", "Frauenfeld", "Stadt Zürich")),
  year_first = 2011,
  year_last = 2023,
  age_fert_min = 15,
  age_fert_max = 49,
  fert_hist_years = 3,
  binational = TRUE
)
```

TFR forecast

``` r
forecast_tfr <- forecast_tfr_mab(
  topic = "tfr",
  topic_data = input$tfr,
  trend_model = c(
    model = "lm", start = 2024, end = 2026, trend_past = 7, trend_prop = 0.5
  ),
  temporal_model = c(
    model = "cubic", start = 2027, end = 2055, trend_prop = 0.8, z0_prop = 0.7,
    z1_prop = 0
  ),
  temporal_end = NA,
  constant_model = c(model = "constant", start = 2056, end = 2075)
)
```

``` r
ggplot(forecast_tfr) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tfr, color = category)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = tfr, color = category)) +
  facet_grid(nat ~ spatial_unit) +
  theme_minimal()
```

MAB forecast

``` r
forecast_mab <- forecast_tfr_mab(
  topic = "mab",
  topic_data = input$mab,
  trend_model = c(
    model = "lm", start = 2024, end = 2026, trend_past = 7, trend_prop = 0.5
  ),
  temporal_model = c(
    model = "Bezier", start = 2027, end = 2055, trend_prop = 0.3, z0_prop = 0.7,
    z1_prop = 0
  ),
  temporal_end = NA,
  constant_model = c(model = "constant", start = 2056, end = 2075)
)
```

``` r
ggplot(forecast_mab) +

Forecast of the age-specific fertility rate

``` r
forecast_fer <- forecast_fertility_rate(
  fer_dat = input$fer,
  tfr_dat = forecast_tfr,
  mab_dat = forecast_mab,
  year_start = 2024,
  year_end = 2075
)
```

``` r
forecast_fer |>
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

Plot with year on x-axis

``` r
y_last <- max(input[["fer_y"]]$year)

forecast_fer |>
  bind_rows(input$fer_y) |>
  filter(age %% 5 == 0) |>
  mutate(age = factor(age)) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = y_last + 1, linetype = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(year, birth_rate, color = age)) +
  facet_grid(nat ~ spatial_unit)
```
